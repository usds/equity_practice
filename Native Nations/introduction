This section serves as an abbreviated entry to better understand the challenges of scoping, planning, and working with sovereign Indigenous Nations. While some of this content is international, Native Nations are in active dialogue with respect to their approach to rightsholding, data sovereignty, and data governance on an international and domestic stage. We encourage you to be innovative and thoughtful with how you use these materials.
