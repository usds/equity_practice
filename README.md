# Equity Toolkit for Project Delivery
A guided set of tools to encourage the adoption of practices for equitable teams and better equity delivery with our agency partners.

## Overview

> "Advancing equity is not a one-year project â€“ it is a generational commitment that will require sustained leadership and partnership with all communities."

>  President Joe Biden

The U.S. Digital Service (USDS) recognizes the critical importance for the civic technology workforce to deliver on equity in its work to transform the way government serves the American public. In fact, USDS was mentioned in [Section 7 of Executive Order 13985: Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/), as one critical group playing a role to promote equitable delivery of government benefits and equitable opportunities.  

As an initial step to provide resources to support USDS teams with equitable delivery, the USDS Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Council (DEIA-C) began envisioning and working on a very initial version (v0) of an Equity Toolkit. The toolkit is ultimately aimed at equipping USDS project leads, teams, and agency partners with a starter set of tools to develop products and services that deliver incrementally on equity. USDS Equity Delivery believes that no matter your role, equity is a part of the job and encourages ongoing efforts to improve upon centering equity in our work. 

This toolkit serves as a starting point within a broader effort to pilot, refine and launch tools, resources, and frameworks that you can use internally and externally in your project work.
