# Your Equity Toolkit for Project Delivery
Are you interested in advancing your team's equity-centered practices? This guided set of tools was created to encourage you and your team in the adoption of practices that improve equity delivery with our agency partners.

## Overview

> "Advancing equity is not a one-year project â€“ it is a generational commitment that will require sustained leadership and partnership with all communities."

The U.S. Digital Service (USDS) recognizes the critical importance for the civic technology workforce to deliver on equity in its work to transform the way government serves the American public. 

Did you know? The USDS was mentioned in [Section 7 of Executive Order 13985: Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/), as one critical group playing a role to promote equitable delivery of government benefits and equitable opportunities.  

You can strengthen how we pursue equity our work and there are many ways to get started. To help you and USDS teams with equitable delivery, the USDS Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Council (DEIA-C) developed a very initial version (v0) of an Equity Toolkit. The toolkit looks to equip USDS project leads, teams, and agency partners with a starter set of tools to develop products and services that deliver incrementally on equity. USDS Equity Delivery believes that no matter your role, equity is a part of the job and encourages ongoing efforts to improve upon centering equity in our work. 

This toolkit serves as a starting point within a broader effort led by the USDS Equity Delivery Team (Celeste Espinoza, Jeremy Zitomer and Alexandra Bornkessel) to pilot, refine and launch tools, resources, and frameworks that you can use internally and externally in your project work.
