## Background

This section introduces project leads and their teams to resources and
tools for defining what the delivery of equity could look like for your
project. While not meant to be prescriptive, this provides a modifiable
approach to equity deliverables throughout the scope of engagement.

## Objectives

Provide core steps for teams to take in scoping and delivering on agency
projects.

## Resource Identification, Analysis, and Assessment Process 

The collection of resources shared in this section is the result of an
environmental scan conducted by members of the DEIA-C where over 50
resources—toolkits, tools and frameworks, were collected, analyzed and
assessed for potential inclusion and/or customization.

-   **Identification.** Input came from 1-1 and small-group
    conversations as well as submissions from 15 USDS staff, snowball
    searches online and using the White House librarians who helped
    identify peer-reviewed resources by limited searches using keywords
    such as “equity” and “toolkit” on PubMed, ERIC, PsychInfo and Web of
    Science databases. Each resource was documented in a matrix table
    noting the resource title, its type, publication year, authorship,
    funder, referral source, format, primary user type, topic (if
    relevant) and use case.

<!-- -->

-   **Analysis.** Once a resource was identified, a “SLOT” analysis was
    conducted with almost a dozen different USDS staff participating.
    This involved a single staff member reviewing each resource and
    identifying the resource’s strengths, limitations, opportunities and
    threats to usage.

-   **Assessment.** Using the SLOT analysis as a primary guide, at least
    2 USDS staff worked together to assess each resource, scoring it as
    a 0 or 1 across three different factors:

    -   Clear Execution: The degree to which the resource was focused
        and contextualized around equity within service delivery
        contexts,

    -   Readiness: The degree to which the resource can be used as-is or
        would benefit from greater refinement and/or customization to
        USDS’s context.

    -   Value to Delivery: The degree to which the resource speaks to
        centering equity in service *delivery* compared to more
        organizational or operational value.

**The top scoring resources are included in this section. This should
not be considered a fully comprehensive inventory of every tool at
project teams’ disposal. Additional resources exist that are not
captured in this phase of the environmental scan. This effort is
intended to be iterative and a starting point for evolving our
approaches.**

*You can find other recommended resources that are valuable, but that
require customization for USDS project delivery in the
[**Appendix**](#_Appendix)*.

## Getting started

Every project at USDS begins with a period of orientation. In some
cases, you might be joining a project that has already oriented itself
towards its mission and objectives; and in other cases, you might
kickoff the project journey together as a team.

Wherever you might begin, four key steps should be undertaken that will
not only help you work better as a team. These steps are articulated in
the [USDS
Handbook](https://tools.usds.gov/handbook/projects/getting-started-on-a-project.md)[^1]
and are intended to set up each team consistently for success.

1.  Understand the leadership structure (for projects in-flight)

2.  Get plugged into project operations (for projects in-flight)

3.  Orient yourself with project background (all new and existing
    projects – continual)

4.  Align on how your team works together and where you're headed (all
    new and existing projects – continual)

### Agency partnership

In addition to the steps outlined above, each team should collaborate
early and regularly to define actors touched, impacted, or acting on
systems that the project touches with their respective agency
stakeholders. The agency should understand the tradeoffs for focusing on
one community or set of users versus another, and use this understanding
as part of routine planning with or without USDS present. There are
valuable resources available in the USDS Handbook to approach persona
development and recruitment strategy that are a natural extension of
these conversations.

We recommend teams begin there, but encourage leading through
collaboration on these exercises to build trust and transparency.

### Segmentation with equity in mind

Identifying the universe of your project can be overwhelming for agency
stakeholders and teams alike. Once there are segments and personas, the
question of who is immediately replaced by *why* and *how*. It is
imperative that teams approach next steps with cultural and emotional
competency.

For this, we include some ideas on [grounding your
project](#grounding-your-project) to understand your position in
relation to who you serve and identify areas where you might need to
consider addressing gaps in competency or approach.

### Objectives and performance indicators based on using common tenets

Technology can help to build equity, but equity is not built by
technology. Our work at USDS calls out this distinction so that we
remain agile, open, and flexible in the development of solutions, but
focused on delivering equity *how it is needed*, which may sometimes be
incongruent with *modern* approaches in private industry.

> In other words, equity won’t be built by applying the [80/20
> rule](https://uxpajournal.org/learning-recognize-exclusion/#:~:text=Over%20the%20years,the%20long%20run.) -
> because it is often the same groups that are excluded (ex: non-English
> speakers, Black people, poor people, disabled people, etc.), but it
> can be built by approaching people’s needs holistically and
> inclusively whenever possible.

We propose a set of [common
tenets](#establishing-project-objectives-on-common-tenets) in
development from the Engineering Community of Practice at USDS to use
and add onto as your project evolves.

### Incorporate a consistent and relevant framework for your project

Having a *guiding star* helps to eliminate questions around your
approach to a project, or why a pivot should be articulated to executive
leadership. Recognizing that no two projects are ever cut from the same
cloth, but that they are similar enough to benefit from incorporating
common practices, we include a [prioritized set of frameworks and
approaches](#framing-and-planning-the-phases-of-your-project) to keep
you on track as you scope and refine the work of your project.

### Meeting the American people where they are

Project teams should aim to be inclusive first and foremost, not as an
after-thought. We encourage teams to consider how to be inclusive in
language, access, and approach early and often. Resources are currently
under development to target this area granularly, but we include
[resources for
teams](#inclusive-approaches-to-language-accessibility-and-design) that
focus on communicating inclusively and incorporating accessibility
patterns and checks for web-based projects.

## Grounding your project

Who we serve and why is often a product of decision-making that has
origins in historical, systemic, and institutionalized bias and
oppression. Prior to beginning a project, we encourage project teams and
their leads to take time to understand who operates in the system that
their project affects, and to better understand their own positionality
– how differences in social position and power shape identities and
access in society - prior to commencing work.

This exercise should not be conflated with “segmentation” or generally,
“understanding users”. Both of these activities are decisions that
happen because of an understanding of the system, its original intent,
and the direction we as technologists are being tasked with evolving it.

Instead, USDS DEIA Council recommends beginning with a positionality
exercise. Projects should anticipate repeating this exercise bi-annually
or at the halfway point of any engagement anticipated to be a year or
longer. This will allow you to baseline and benchmark your efforts to
communicate the degree to which you are serving as many parties as
possible equitably.

Should a team determine that engaging with tribal nations is necessary
through one or both of the exercises provided above, the Council
recommends an additional step of visiting the [Tribal
Engagement](https://github.com/usds/tribal-engagement/blob/main/4.0%20training-and-further-reading.md)
repository, led by Emily Mann, to work through an appropriate and
respectful strategy for engagement. All USDS staff should familiarize
themselves with the content in this repository as it provides background
on the historical relationship of the federal government with tribal
nations, as well as a preliminary framework for determining the
viability and suitability off engaging tribal nations on a project. In
some cases, either because of the proposed tenure or due to
jurisdictional or organizational relationships, tribal engagement in a
formal sense might be ill advised.

## Establishing project objectives on common tenets

There are situations when a project, because of its urgency, cannot
afford the time for a robust approach to who it serves. Nevertheless,
all projects at USDS share common tenets for how work should be aligned
for delivering equity.

When considering or planning technical, social, or organizational
recommendations for your project, measure your recommendations against
these core tenets.

1.  When a constraint requires burdening someone, burden the most
    privileged group

    -   ***Prioritize burdening groups in this order***

        -   *Stakeholders*

        -   *Development team*

        -   *Staff members who serve them*

        -   *Individuals served and those they authorize to act on their
            behalf*

2.  Optimize for ease of use by the most vulnerable population you serve
    over other considerations

3.  Take maintenance burdens and post-MVP state into consideration when
    assessing technical decisions

4.  Recommendations should be treated as flexible, governed by
    information available

While these tenets place a larger maintenance and development burden on
the team that builds and maintains the technology, the result is reduced
burden and an easier experience for the people our work is intended to
serve.

Always provide tradeoff options and reasoning to allow for flexibility
as development occurs and the realities surrounding this work evolves.

## Framing and planning the phases of your project

Our work at USDS is powered by the collection, interpretation, and
dissemination of data that represents the American people. Using a
framework to understand your responsibilities during a project can help
scope outcomes and build better relationships with the people you serve.

We strongly recommend these frameworks and playbooks for efforts that
are ongoing and for those at their nascence. They are listed in order
based on quickness to implement, followed by overall usefulness.

-   [**We All Count Data Equity
    Framework**](https://weallcount.com/the-data-process/)

An equity framework aimed at addressing drivers and positionality before
and during a research or data science project. Can be used as a
lightweight, adaptable framework for most USDS projects.

| The recommendations for gathering and reporting demographic data are concise and helpful. This framework challenges teams to define what vision of the world they are baking into their analysis, and emphasizes that equitable data work is about acknowledging the perspective of your data and being clear about who and how your analysis might demonstrate privilege. The framework provides a foundational set of plays with a focus on the role data takes in communicating the story of affected and impacted communities. | This framework provides viable steps that can further define a project seeking to establish equity as a deliverable in a manner that goes beyond the USDS playbook. It can give color and definition where teams might not have it explicitly outlined in current organizational plays. |

| This is a known and widely adopted framework in public health, health education, health marketing, social marketing and behavior change circles. It helps inform how to allocate resources and is a helpful tool to prioritize targets as a "market of greatest opportunity”, an area where many agencies struggle. It incorporates many factors for consideration, including equity, along with openness to change, which is a key component when behavior change is a desired goal. | TARPARE is a useful and flexible model for understanding the various segments in a population of interest and for assessing the potential viability of interventions directed at each segment. The model is particularly useful when there is a need to prioritize segments in terms of available budgets. Care should be taken to translate it into plain language to help facilitate understanding. |

## Inclusive approaches to language, accessibility, and design

Foundational to the delivering equity on USDS projects is the active
incorporation of inclusive language and design, and accessibility at all
phases from start to finish. The DEIA Council, with leadership from
Louise Clark, is developing an [Accessibility Resource
repository](https://github.com/usds/accessibility) for including and
evaluating accessibility on USDS projects. The resources provided in
this section are intended to assist projects in meeting these objectives
as this repository is developed and matured.

1.  [**Inclusive Design
    (Microsoft)**](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)

An online set of principles, tools and activities to center inclusive
design across the product development lifecycle. Includes video primers
on core topics.

| **Strengths**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Opportunities**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| This is a vetted and well-maintained toolkit by Microsoft that can be leveraged as a primer for how to think about inclusion that is relevant to all communities of practice. Lightweight exercises and videos are given for incorporating inclusion into the development lifecycle. | This gives any practitioner a steady introduction to cognition inclusion and other topics that are relevant to USDSers in a meaningful way. It could be used in combination with positionality exercises to continuously reflect back on who a user is and how best to serve them. |

2.  [**Inclusive Language
    Guide**](https://policy-practice.oxfam.org/resources/inclusive-language-guide-621487/)

A guide provided internally and externally by OXFAM to consider choice
of language within context. The tool was developed to facilitate
transitioning to language models that deconstruct rather than reinforce
language patterns that contribute to power imbalance, stereotype,
discrimination, bias, and a lack of inclusion.

| **Strengths**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Opportunities**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The guide provides concrete, actionable language recommendations with established rationale for addressing a diverse intersection of populations. It also explains concepts in plain language with rationale for intended use of the tool and its limitations. | This guide can be used immediately for content development respective to a community. In combination with positionality exercises, it can be used to introduce team members and stakeholders’ alternative language to describe and communicate with a community. While somewhat lengthy, this guide is a much-needed asset during mapping and engagement activities within a community. |

3.  [**USWDS Inclusive Design
    Patterns**](https://designsystem.digital.gov/patterns/inclusive-design/)

A toolkit that prescribes patterns for inclusive language with respect
to forms and other user-centered digital engagement.

| **Strengths**                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Opportunities**                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This tool is easily referenced and consistent, providing meaningful use across government agencies and for use at USDS. It is intentionally developed and established for government context. | This tool can be used immediately to drive consistent and appropriate language in the development of forms and in decision-making around critical or necessary data fields. |

4.  [**Essential Accessibility
    Annotations**](https://teams.omb.gov/team/USDS/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=w86MD8SPfRWJpkvL9Ygb8y08SK2%2F833DBc90eIMOYpg%3D&docid=2_0d1dd74187bd341ceb6e1b86b7b4d5766&rev=1)

A presentation aimed at designers for capturing minimum accessibility
criteria prior to handoff.

| **Strengths**                                                                                                 | **Opportunities**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| This provides tools to assess and document accessibility issues prior to handoff or as part of design review. | This is a good and comprehensive primer for both design review and larger QA activities assessing accessibility. Some teams might consider developing it into a simple set of heuristics for evaluating accessibility early and often if the project output is public facing and on the web. |

5.  [**Accessibility Documentation for
    Designers**](https://teams.omb.gov/team/USDS/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=1HRjSlsNpTWdoeG6Xz9ssJ2ReLLADlXmJ%2Be6VVsXlAc%3D&docid=2_097d869c817c44382a1d8635f3d3345a4&rev=1)

A presentation that proposes how to go about documenting accessibility
criteria on a project and the fundamentals for why this is important in
product development and handoff.

| **Strengths**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Opportunities**                                                                                                                                                                        |
