## Glossary of Terms Related to Equity 
When thinking about how we achieve equity in our work it is import to
define and acknowledge language that is related to equity. Please find a
starter list of terms that have been identified by the USDS DEIA Council
and know that this list will grow over time (and that you can add to
it!). [More terms can be found at
https://www.feminuity.org.](https://teams.omb.gov/team/USDS/Shared%20Documents/DEIA%20equity%20toolkit/Toolkit%20Drafts/More%20terms%20can%20be%20found%20at%20https:/www.feminuity.org.)

Remember that language is critically important, highly imperfect, and
ever-evolving!

**Marginalized:** More commonly used in academia, social
work/justice/movements. Refers to those deprived of institutional power
to create change or those who are most likely to experience various
forms of exclusion. Occurs when someone’s identity is undervalued or
discriminated against. Does not necessarily mean underrepresentation.

**Underserved:** More commonly used in government (at least more
recently), to recognize the role racism, discrimination and other forms
of oppression play in denying certain individuals and communities full
access to services, opportunities, and participation in systems.
Executive Order 13895 lists the following groups as underserved: Black,
Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious
minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+)
persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and
persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or
inequality. ”

**Underrepresented:** More commonly used to speak about a low number of
a specific identity relative to general population.

**Lived Experience:** Personal knowledge about the world gained through
direct, first-hand involvement in everyday events rather than through
representations constructed by other people.

**Diversity**: The achievement of a workforce composition that all
stakeholders, especially individuals and communities who are
traditionally underserved and marginalized, trust to represent the
public we serve.

**Inclusion:** The achievement of an environment that all stakeholders,
especially individuals and communities who are traditionally underserved
and marginalized, trust to be safe, supportive, welcoming, and
respectful.

**Accessibility:** The design, development, procurement and maintenance
of inclusive technology, information, programs, services, and facilities
so that all stakeholders and those we serve, especially individuals and
communities who are traditionally underserved and marginalized -
including those who are disabled - can fully and independently use them.

**Intersectionality:** Acknowledges that people have overlapping
identities and lived experiences complicating their relationship to
prejudice and oppression.

**Psychological Safety:** The individual, team, or organizational belief
that an environment allows for risk taking, vulnerability, and failure.
One of the ways that we measure inclusion.

**Belonging:** The extent to which people feel part of a larger whole in
a group setting. One of the ways that we measure inclusion.

**Mattering:** Consists of engaging employees in workplace decisions,
building a culture of gratitude and recognition, and connecting
individual work with organizational mission. One of the ways we measure
inclusion.

**Safe Spaces:** a supportive, non-threatening environment that enables
a participant to feel there is no risk to expressing themselves and
sharing their thoughts/experiences

**Brave Spaces:** a supportive environment that enables a participant to
feel comfortable taking a certain amount of risk in order to express
themselves or share their thoughts/experiences

Regardless of the policies or norms that a space espouses, whether a
space is “safe” or “brave” or neither is in the eyes of each individual
who participates. A safe space for one person might be a brave space for
another, and a safe space for someone when discussing a particular topic
might not be a safe space for that person when they discuss a different
topic that feels more risk-laden.
