# What do we mean by equity?
According to Executive Order (EO) 14091: Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Govt (Signed 02/16/2023)

> Equity is the consistent and systematic treatment of all individuals in a fair, just, and impartial manner, including individuals who belong to communities that often have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander persons and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; women and girls; LGBTQI+ persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; persons who live in United States Territories; persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality; and individuals who belong to multiple such communities.

## USDS Measurable Working Definition of Equity
While the definition above is helpful as a starting point, synthesizing commonly used definitions of equity from the World Health Organization and the field of health equity gives us a measurable definition of equity that may be helpful for our purposes:

> Equity is the **absence of unfair and avoidable differences in lived outcomes (and their determinants, including social determinants)** among population groups defined socially, economically, demographically or geographically. 

### What are some strategies for achieving more equitable outcomes?
To eliminate disparities in lived outcomes across population groups, we must understand that everyone is not starting at the same place, nor shares the exact same goals, so there will never be a one-size fits all solution. Some ways to focus on equity include addressing common inequities that underserved groups face such as: under-resourcing / disinvestment, overburdening, barriers to access & full participation, systemic drivers of inequity (e.g. policies or govt/business activities with discriminatory impacts), chronic underrepresentation / invisibility / erasure, and disproportionately negative experiences & outcomes. 

## 12 high-level strategies to consider to achieve more equitable outcomes
1.	**Work with your agency partners early and often to identify opportunities to create impact through DEIA goals set in their organization and their agency equity action plans.**
3.	**Define all of the users and actors within your problem space and assess their risk and vulnerability.**    
  a.    _Who has the highest probability of being the most vulnerable or most negatively impacted by a solution?_    
  b.	  _What disparities exist across the people being served in this problem space?_    
  c.	  _Make your best assessment of the need(s) of each distinct group of people in this problem space. How does this differ across groups?_    
  d.	  _Are there people who should be served who are not presently being served?_    
  e.	  _Where is the funding coming from? What are the motivations?_    
5.	**Allow the most vulnerable users and actors within your problem space to help define the core problem to be solved, as pre-ordained problem statements often bake in inaccurate assumptions about the importance of that problem across population groups.**    
   a.	_In order for your problem statement to resonate with the most vulnerable people in your target population, what would need to be true about them? For example, the problem statement "Overly complex language for bus fares creates unequal access to public transit cards across population groups" may matter less to a population who doesn't have any bus stops within walking distance due to historical [redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining)._
7.	**[Prioritize the most vulnerable users first](https://www.newamerica.org/new-practice-lab/racial-equity-framework/blog/the-new-practice-labs-racial-equity-framework/) even at the expense of easier wins. This approach is more likely to result in more viable solutions for all people we are trying to serve.**
   a.	_Define the real-world tradeoffs of getting something done fast versus getting the right thing done for the most impact. Who is most affected by this decision, how, and to what magnitude?_
9.	**In the absence of explicit prioritization of equity, assume inequitable results. Systemic discrimination is deeply baked into the systems, spaces, and language we navigate everyday, and it is often hard to anticipate where and how its impacts will emerge.**    
    a.	_Are you working with any language, designs, systems, metrics, procedures, etc that have not explicitly prioritized equity? (ex: people most impacted by services don’t speak English and project scope doesn’t account for conducting research in other languages)_    
    b.	_What would need to change about those things to ensure they are interpreted/used equitably?_
11.	**Evangelize with stakeholders the notion that solutioning for those most affected will yield a viable solution for all users. (ex: WIC team approach for solving with people with language barriers helped solve for all users; curb cuts).**
12.	**Maximize opportunities for vulnerable people with relevant lived experience (or their proxies, like CBO employees or agency equity experts) to be present in meetings, particularly where decisions are made. Inequitable decisions are more likely to be interrupted when the voices of impacted individuals are present.**
    a.	_What would the most vulnerable members of your target population say about the decision you are making? Does it dignify them, prioritize them, consider them, ignore them, exploit them, endanger them?_
14.	**Where possible, address upstream systemic drivers of the inequities you are targeting, instead of their symptoms.**    
    a.	_What policies, government/business activities, socioeconomic trends or disparities, etc might be root causes of the inequity you are targeting? Of those causes, which do you have the power to address or influence your agency partners to address?_
16.	**Be mindful when developing engagement strategies to prioritize target groups in a way that considers need, resources, and a variety of demographic factors and their intersections such as geography, sexual orientation, class, race, ethnicity, language, age, and disability.**
    a.	Work with stakeholders to decide on an index that works best for your problem space and use it consistently to think about your segments
18.	**Note opportunities for equitable reallocation of resources, reducing constituent burden, and increasing direct participation in the design of systems with those impacted with your Stakeholders and Leadership.**
19.	**Default to transparency: open meetings, open source, open minutes, open communications, etc. Set a norm of justifying when processes should not be transparent instead of justifying when they should be.**
20.	**Above all, lead with courage.** There may be times when you are the first to suggest an idea and/or where you get pushback – this is to be expected! Change is hard, even if it pushes us to be better. _USDS owns part of the responsibility of making things better, and sometimes the better combined with a plan for the best is what's needed to lead the work forward._
