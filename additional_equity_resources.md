# Resources worthy of adaptation for current and future teams

## Resource Identification, Analysis, and Assessment Process 

The collection of resources shared in this section is the result of an
environmental scan conducted by members of the DEIA-C where over 50
resources—toolkits, tools and frameworks, were collected, analyzed and
assessed for potential inclusion and/or customization.

-   **Identification.** Input came from 1-1 and small-group
    conversations as well as submissions from 15 USDS staff, snowball
    searches online and using the White House librarians who helped
    identify peer-reviewed resources by limited searches using keywords
    such as “equity” and “toolkit” on PubMed, ERIC, PsychInfo and Web of
    Science databases. Each resource was documented in a matrix table
    noting the resource title, its type, publication year, authorship,
    funder, referral source, format, primary user type, topic (if
    relevant) and use case.

<!-- -->

-   **Analysis.** Once a resource was identified, a “SLOT” analysis was
    conducted with almost a dozen different USDS staff participating.
    This involved a single staff member reviewing each resource and
    identifying the resource’s strengths, limitations, opportunities and
    threats to usage.

-   **Assessment.** Using the SLOT analysis as a primary guide, at least
    2 USDS staff worked together to assess each resource, scoring it as
    a 0 or 1 across three different factors:

    -   Clear Execution: The degree to which the resource was focused
        and contextualized around equity within service delivery
        contexts,

    -   Readiness: The degree to which the resource can be used as-is or
        would benefit from greater refinement and/or customization to
        USDS’s context.

    -   Value to Delivery: The degree to which the resource speaks to
        centering equity in service *delivery* compared to more
        organizational or operational value.

**The top scoring resources are included in this section. This should
not be considered a fully comprehensive inventory of every tool at
project teams’ disposal. Additional resources exist that are not
captured in this phase of the environmental scan. This effort is
intended to be iterative and a starting point for evolving our
approaches.**

During the course of the environmental scan, the Council came across 11
resources that would provide clear value to our objectives for
delivering equity, but were not ready for immediate use.

## Resources worthy of adaptation for teams

A number of resources that would provide clear value to our objectives
for delivering equity, but that were not ready for immediate use by
teams are identified below. The Council recommends these resources to
teams and leaders willing to meet the challenge of adapting them for
their work and sharing the results with the larger USDS body.

1.  [**A Framework for Public Health Action: The Health Impact
    Pyramid**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2836340/)

A framework that outlines least to most impactful categories of public
health intervention, which also go from most to least burdensome on
members of marginalized populations. The categories are: counseling and
education, clinical interventions, long-lasting protective
interventions, changing the context to make individuals' default
decisions healthy, and changing socioeconomic factors.

<td>The framework clearly lays out which kinds of programs and structural changes are likely to enact the most meaningful change to lived outcomes and translates really cleanly to health equity.</td>
<td>This is a great resource for project scoping, both at the leadership project selection and allocation phase, and at the "which part of this problem should we focus on and why" phase of project creation once a team has already been established, and during the initial discovery process.</td>
<td><p>The context and intent of this framework is health equity, but its contents are generalizable to other subject areas.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Document a generalizable version for use by USDS project teams that considers alternatives to clinical language.</p>
<p>The framework doesn't lay out how to execute program implementation and product development, even as it helps in the context of pre-hoc impact assessment and problem scoping.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Document a piloted path forward for other teams to begin using this framework for implementation. It could be a reimagining of the framework or adapting it as a set of heuristics.</p></td>

<td>A simple set of questions that Project Leads could utilize in scoping exercises early on to determine outcomes prior to moving a project forward after discovery and upon kickoff of a project.

    communities**](https://www.ncai.org/attachments/PolicyPaper_SpMCHTcjxRRjMEjDnPmesENPzjHTwhOlOWxlWOIWdSrykJuQggG_NCAI-WalkSoftly.pdf)

This paper shares insights that emerged out of tribal research
regulation and research partnership work to foster responsible research
with American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities.

<td>This paper includes reflections from tribal citizens and academic researchers engaged in research with tribal nations. In addition to principles and core values, it also includes vignettes to demonstrate how principles are applied in the field.</td>
<td>The contents of this paper could be used to ground USDS teams considering a project aimed at engaging directly with tribal nations to understand the importance of developing long-term, trusting relationships. This could inform better partnership with agency tribal liaisons and offices, and shape and scope our projects accordingly. </td>
<td><p><em>Walk Softly…</em> was not included in recommendations because it is very focused on AI/AN and not necessarily generalized to other underserved communities.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Select and adapt the principles and core values contained in the paper so that they can be used more broadly for all underserved and overburdened communities.</p>
<p>Additionally, <em>Walk Softly…</em> addresses the need for a longer “runway” for engaging with tribal nations, recognized or otherwise. A commitment by agencies to partner and build lasting relationships (both federal and tribal) is not the only requirement. USDS’s recognition and leadership around the fundamental importance of working with tribal nations is a problem to be solved.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Build on existing recommendations made in the Tribal Engagement repository by proposing internal USDS steps for identifying how to build leadership in this space despite term limits</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 3:</strong> Pilot and document novel plays for building out this capacity in an agency that could be extensible across federal agencies.</p></td>

<td>The positionality questions that are included in this toolkit could be an opportunity to share the responsibility of approach with leadership, in addition to serving as an alignment for teams. This is a very neutral and well defined toolkit making it suitable for use by most teams.</td>
<td><p>GRID proposes inquiries that might not always be suitable for a project lead or team to answer, and that might, in most cases, be about why the work was selected in the first place. The latter is something that is often worked out by leadership in conjunction with an agency partner.</p>

| Don Norman is a recognized voice in design and human-centered product development which makes the article an acceptable starting point for considering how inclusion makes all outcomes better. | This is a decent article that can is packaged easily for USDS consumption. It can be used as a conversation starter on a team, or packaged as part of onboarding materials for new staff. | **Challenge 1:** Take the contents of this article and develop an expanded set of heuristics beyond N/N to frame and evaluate approach and execution of product design. |

<td>This is a well-received and recognized framework which asks questions such as: "Equity - who gets to do design?" or "Values - what values do we encode or reproduce in the objects and systems we design?" Because it is backed by a strong community, projects leads and teams have a means to further explore ways to turn conceptual principles into concrete actions. </td>

10. [**Data Feminism**](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/)

A framework for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help
them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their
efforts on the growing field of data science. This framework is less
about gender, and is instead centered on power: who has it and who
doesn't, and how those differentials of power can be challenged and
changed.
