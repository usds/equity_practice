# Situating Equity in Our Current Government Context
Codifying a commitment to equity has been an explicit theme in the Biden-Harris Administration. Executive Orders are one key place we can view this commitment. 

This section begins with a high level summary of agency-submitted Equity Action Plans, a directive of Executive Order 13985. Additionally, it lays out the key executive orders (Executive Order 13985 and 14091) that impact USDS and their agency partners.

## Overall Takeaways from Agency Equity Action Plans
The Urban Institute provided an analysis of the 24 CFO Act Agencies equity action plans. Overall the plans focused on early wins and foundational tasks or tactics. The Urban Institute grouped goals and commitments into three operational approaches to equity: procedural equity, distributional equity, and structural equity. These three categories can also be seen as three stages of equity, although because they are interrelated, they may not occur in every agency in the order in which we present them. Through analysis the plans tended to focus more on procedural lacking identify plans on how distributional and structural equity will be applied. Please find highlights of their findings. We break down the types of equity work that can be found in the plans. In addition, we have provided high level actions identified by some of the agencies USDS works with. 

### Procedural equity
This approach to equity that ensures processes are fair for target participants. Many of the executive order's requirements (e.g., assessing whether and to what extent programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved groups) fall under procedural equity. For example, every equity action plan lists some improvement to data collection as a key step for advancing racial equity. Though improving the quality and quantity of data broken down into categories such as race can help agencies understand inequities, it is an administrative action that changes a process but does not necessarily include changes in decision making or outcomes.

|     Agency                           |     Action                                                                                                                                                                |

|     Health and Human Services        |     Translating more agency documents; updating language access plan                                                                                                      |

### Distributional equity
This approach involves programmatic and resource decisions and changes that are likely to (re)allocate resources in ways that increase access to agency programs and services for people who have historically been excluded from them. Proposed new strategies for publicizing and acquiring services from a broader range of vendors. Distributional equity also includes program eligibility and accessibility. 

Few plans defined distributional equity in their action plans and those that did tended to focus on ways to open up complicated processes for accessing federal funds.  The plans tend not to specify whether groups that were excluded from programs in the past will now receive additional or compensatory program services in ways that boost their outcomes. 

|     Agency                                                     |     Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Structural equity
Refers to more comprehensive equity commitments that involve changing an organization's structures or incentives to improve outcomes. Exemplars not only acknowledge the past structures that created or sustained historical harm (such as redlining in housing), but also propose new structures or designs to remedy past harms as a way to create equitable outcomes today. Several agencies proposed changes to their decision-making structures and how they frame their impact. Ways of doing that included changing performance plans, creating leadership positions that are devoted to equity, create sub agencies offices to lead more equity focused work.

### Proposed Future Actions 
The Urban Institute identified the below proposed areas of focus to continue prioritizing equity:     
    
•	Data collection: Collect more detailed demographic data, particularly on race and ethnicity. Go beyond individual characteristics and include new system-level outcomes.    
•	Equity measurement: Develop new indicators of equity. Go beyond reporting on disparities in inputs or outputs between racial groups and report on equity impact.    
•	Outreach: Conduct outreach to new or historically underserved communities, ideally with more cultural competence and language access.    
•	Procurement: More intentionally prepare, release, review, and award grants and contracts, and link these with targeted outreach.    
•	Program improvement: Make programs more accessible by simplifying them or providing navigation assistance, and evaluate whether these changes improve equity-related outcomes.    
•	Staffing: Advance internal/organizational hiring and professional development practices, ideally to reduce bias in decision-making.

## Highlights from Equity-Focused Executive Orders 13895 and 14091
### [<span id="_Toc134189715" class="anchor"></span>**Executive Order (EO) 13985: Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/) [(Signed 01/20/2021)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/)

EO 13985 was signed into law the first day of the Biden-Harris
Administration. This order calls on Federal agencies to advance equity
by identifying and addressing barriers to equal opportunity that
underserved communities may face because of some government policies and
programs.

#### Highlights 

##### Section 1: Policy

By advancing equity across the Federal Government, we can create
opportunities for the improvement of communities that have been
historically underserved, which benefits everyone.  For example, an
analysis shows that closing racial gaps in wages, housing credit,
lending opportunities, and access to higher education would amount to an
additional $5 trillion in gross domestic product in the American economy
over the next 5 years.  Each agency must assess whether, and to what
extent, its programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to
opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved
groups.  Such assessments will better equip agencies to develop policies
and programs that deliver resources and benefits equitably to all.

##### Section 3: Role of Domestic Policy Council (DPC)

The DPC will coordinate efforts to embed equity principles, policies,
and approaches across the Federal Government.  This will include efforts
to remove systemic barriers to and provide equal access to opportunities
and benefits, identify communities the Federal Government has
underserved, and develop policies designed to advance equity for those
communities.

##### Section 5: Conducting an Equity Assessment in Federal Agencies

Within 200 days of E.O. 13985 agencies were to conduct equity
assessments on:

-   Potential barriers that underserved communities and individuals may
    face to enrollment in and access to benefits and services in Federal
    programs; 

-   Potential barriers that underserved communities and individuals may
    face in taking advantage of agency procurement and contracting
    opportunities;

-   Whether new policies, regulations, or guidance documents may be
    necessary to advance equity in agency actions and programs; and

-   The operational status and level of institutional resources
    available to offices or divisions within the agency that are
    responsible for advancing civil rights or whose mandates
    specifically include serving underrepresented or disadvantaged
    communities.

##### Section 6: Allocating Federal Resources to Advance Fairness and Opportunity

This includes opportunities to promote equity in the budget that the
Director of OMB submits to Congress as well as allocating Federal
resources in a manner that increases investment in underserved
communities.

##### Section 7: Promoting Equitable Delivery of Government Benefits & Equitable Opportunities. 

USDS is named to support agencies with developing plans to address any
barriers to full and equal participation in programs and procurement.

##### Section 8: Engagement with Member of Underserved Communities

Agencies are called to consult with members of communities that have
been historically underrepresented in Federal Government and underserved
by, or subject to discrimination in, Federal policies and programs.

##### Section 9: Establishing an Equitable Data Working Group

Interagency Working Group on equitable data established, USDS has a seat
on this.

#### Why This Matters to You and USDS

This executive order calls agencies to listen to people from underserved
communities, consult with them, and uncover and recognize the barriers
they face accessing and using services, to begin to craft solutions that
advance equity. USDS is specifically referenced in this E.O. because
we’ve been instrumental in helping agencies adopt human-centered design
practices that empower them to listen to and design with their
customers. It’s even in our core values: “design with users, not for
them” and “find the truth, tell the truth.” But listening to the public
and telling the truth about what we learn is just the first step. To
truly drive equity outcomes, we can support our agency partners by
modeling and helping them adopt practices and mindsets that center
underserved customers in government service delivery.

USDS’s mission is to deliver better government services through
technology and design. The question to ask ourselves is “better for
whom”? In order to create better services that are inclusive of people
from underserved communities - services that recognize, are respectful
of, and account for their experiences - we need those communities better
represented on our teams. Improving the diversity at USDS will take
time, but we can all be a part of the solution by leveraging the
resources in this toolkit to foster inclusive cultures on our teams,
develop equity mindsets to continually shape our work, design with
underserved communities throughout our project lifecycles, and
prioritize accessibility in our practices.

### [<span id="_Toc134189725" class="anchor"></span>**EO 14091: Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Govt**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/) ([Signed 02/16/2023)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/)

Executive Order (EO) 14091, “Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support
for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government”, targets
specific barriers still faced by underserved communities by requiring
federal agencies to integrate equity into planning and decision-making.
EO 14091 extends and strengthens equity-advancing requirements for
federal agencies with the intent to deliver better outcomes for the
American people. The EO outlines a multi-pronged approach to advancing
equity through the federal government, including:

#### Highlights

##### Section 2: Establishing Equity-Focused Leadership Across the Federal Government

Agencies are called to create an Agency Equity Team within their
agencies to coordinate the implementation of equity initiatives and
ensure that their agencies are delivering equitable outcomes for the
American people. The team will support and delivery equity training and
equity leadership development for staff across all levels.

##### Section 3: Delivering Equitable Outcomes Through Government Policies, Programs, and Activities

An established team will support ongoing implementation of a
comprehensive equity strategy that uses the agency’s policy, budgetary,
programmatic, service-delivery, procurement, data-collection processes,
grantmaking, public engagement, research and evaluation, and regulatory
functions to enable the agency’s mission and service delivery to yield
equitable outcomes for all Americans, including underserved communities.

##### Section 4: Embedding Equity into Government-Wide Processes

The Director of OMB shall consider opportunities to review and update
internal processes, directives, and Government-wide guidance (such as
OMB Circulars and Memoranda) to support equitable decision-making,
promote equitable deployment of financial and technical assistance, and
assist agencies in advancing equity, as appropriate and wherever
possible.

##### Section 5: Delivering Equitable Outcomes in Partnership with Underserved Communities

Agencies must increase engagement with underserved communities by
identifying and applying innovative approaches to improve the quality,
frequency, and accessibility of engagement. This will be done through

-   proactive engagement, as appropriate, with members of underserved
    communities

-   collaboration with OMB, as appropriate, to identify and develop
    tools and methods for engagement with underserved communities,
    including those related to agency budget development and rulemaking

-   creating more flexibilities, incentives, and guidelines for
    recipients of Federal funding and permits to proactively engage with
    underserved communities as projects are designed and implemented

-   identifying funding opportunities for community- and faith-based
    organizations working in and with underserved communities to improve
    access to benefits and services for members of underserved
    communities

-   identifying and addressing barriers for individuals with
    disabilities, as well as older adults, to participate in the
    engagement process, including barriers to the accessibility of
    physical spaces, virtual platforms, presentations, systems,
    training, and documents

##### Section 6: Creating Economic Opportunity in Rural America and Advancing Urban Equitable Development

Support rural communities identify and access Federal resources in order
to create equitable economic opportunity and advance projects that build
community wealth, including by providing or supporting technical
assistance; incentivizing the creation of good, high-paying union jobs
in rural areas; conducting outreach to and soliciting input from rural
community leaders; and contributing new resources and support to
interagency programs such as the Rural Partners Network.

##### Section 7: Advancing Equitable Procurement

The Government-wide goal for Federal procurement dollars awarded to
small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals (SDBs) shall be 15 percent in
Fiscal Year 2025. OMB shall set a Government-wide SDB goal for Fiscal
Year 2024. Agencies will also create procurement opportunities for SDBs
through Federal financial assistance.

##### Section 8: Affirmatively Advancing Civil Rights

Agencies are called to elevate their respective civil rights offices,
including by directing that their most senior civil rights officer
report to the agency head. Commit that civil rights offices are
consulted on decisions regarding the design, development, acquisition,
and use of artificial intelligence and automated systems. Increase
coordination, communication, and engagement with community-based
organizations and civil rights organizations. Last agencies will prevent
and remedy discrimination, including by protecting the public from
algorithmic discrimination.

##### Section 9: Further Advancing Equitable Data Practices

The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) National Science and
Technology Council Subcommittee on Equitable Data will coordinate the
implementation of relevant recommendations of the Interagency Working
Group on Equitable Data established in Executive Order 13985. The
Director of OSTP. (E.O. 14091 Sec 9)

#### Why This Matters to You and USDS

This executive order goes beyond just listening to underserved
communities and individuals, and calls agencies to act on what they
learn and establish structures like equity teams and civil rights
offices that will drive the continuous practice of advancing equity. The
E.O. specifically highlights requests for a couple of practices in which
USDS typically plays an influential role: data and customer engagement
(also known as user research). It’s imperative that we develop equity
mindsets and leverage frameworks that center equity as we embark on data
work and customer engagement so that we're supporting agencies in the
delivery of solutions that drive equity outcomes for their customers. We
can connect with the equity teams and civil rights offices that are
being established at our partner agencies to support each other in
centering underserved communities in technology solutions and lay out
the benefits and risks of implementing a tech solution based on
different circumstances.

**Equity Action Plans for Agencies**

Based on directives in EO 13985, Equity Action Plans were submitted by
over 90 Federal agencies, including all Cabinet and Chief Financial
Officer (CFO) Act Agencies, as well as more than 50 independent agencies
that voluntarily participated, in recognition of the value and urgency
of applying an equity lens to improve agency performance and service
delivery. These Equity Action Plans represent specific agency
commitments to redress inequities and to promote equitable outcomes in
communities.

Agency Equity Action Plans include innovative new strategies that
agencies are using for the first time to embed equity in day-to-day
governing by

-   Reducing administrative burdens and simplifying government services

-   Engaging with stakeholders and communities who have been
    historically excluded from policy making processes

-   Narrowing wealth gaps through federal contracting and procurement

-   Delivery equity through grantmaking

-   Building accountability for equity through data collection and
    reporting.

CFO Act Agencies Equity Plans can be found at
<https://www.performance.gov/equity>

Each action plan can help inform USDSers on the barriers and
opportunities that agencies have identify and how it may affect projects
USDS partners with agencies on. The plans can also help USDSers promote
accountability and inform planning and implementation strategy on teams.

\*\*It should be noted due to the newness of the E.O and the creating of
the Equity Action plans, this section should be reviewed regularly and
updates should be made.
