# Situating Equity in Our Current Government Context
Codifying a commitment to equity has been an explicit theme in the Biden-Harris Administration. Executive Orders are one key place we can view this commitment. 

This section begins with a high level summary of agency-submitted Equity Action Plans, a directive of Executive Order 13985. Additionally, it lays out the key executive orders (Executive Order 13985 and 14091) that impact USDS and their agency partners.

## Overall Takeaways from Agency Equity Action Plans
The Urban Institute provided an analysis of the 24 CFO Act Agencies equity action plans. Overall the plans focused on early wins and foundational tasks or tactics. The Urban Institute grouped goals and commitments into three operational approaches to equity: procedural equity, distributional equity, and structural equity. These three categories can also be seen as three stages of equity, although because they are interrelated, they may not occur in every agency in the order in which we present them. Through analysis the plans tended to focus more on procedural lacking identify plans on how distributional and structural equity will be applied. Please find highlights of their findings. We break down the types of equity work that can be found in the plans. In addition, we have provided high level actions identified by some of the agencies USDS works with. 

### Procedural equity
This approach to equity that ensures processes are fair for target participants. Many of the executive order's requirements (e.g., assessing whether and to what extent programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved groups) fall under procedural equity. For example, every equity action plan lists some improvement to data collection as a key step for advancing racial equity. Though improving the quality and quantity of data broken down into categories such as race can help agencies understand inequities, it is an administrative action that changes a process but does not necessarily include changes in decision making or outcomes.

|     Agency                           |     Action                                                                                                                                                                |

### Distributional equity
This approach involves programmatic and resource decisions and changes that are likely to (re)allocate resources in ways that increase access to agency programs and services for people who have historically been excluded from them. Proposed new strategies for publicizing and acquiring services from a broader range of vendors. Distributional equity also includes program eligibility and accessibility. 

Few plans defined distributional equity in their action plans and those that did tended to focus on ways to open up complicated processes for accessing federal funds.  The plans tend not to specify whether groups that were excluded from programs in the past will now receive additional or compensatory program services in ways that boost their outcomes.

|     Health and Human Services                                  |     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Minority Health partnered to develop a new measure, the Minority Health Social Vulnerability   Index, to identify racial and ethnic communities at the greatest risk of adverse outcomes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reductions in that index score should correspond to improved well-being and result from newly targeted investments.    |

### Structural equity
Refers to more comprehensive equity commitments that involve changing an organization's structures or incentives to improve outcomes. Exemplars not only acknowledge the past structures that created or sustained historical harm (such as redlining in housing), but also propose new structures or designs to remedy past harms as a way to create equitable outcomes today. Several agencies proposed changes to their decision-making structures and how they frame their impact. Ways of doing that included changing performance plans, creating leadership positions that are devoted to equity, create sub agencies offices to lead more equity focused work.

### Proposed Future Actions 
The Urban Institute identified the below proposed areas of focus to continue prioritizing equity:     
    
•	Data collection: Collect more detailed demographic data, particularly on race and ethnicity. Go beyond individual characteristics and include new system-level outcomes.    
•	Equity measurement: Develop new indicators of equity. Go beyond reporting on disparities in inputs or outputs between racial groups and report on equity impact.    
•	Outreach: Conduct outreach to new or historically underserved communities, ideally with more cultural competence and language access.    
•	Procurement: More intentionally prepare, release, review, and award grants and contracts, and link these with targeted outreach.    
•	Program improvement: Make programs more accessible by simplifying them or providing navigation assistance, and evaluate whether these changes improve equity-related outcomes.    
•	Staffing: Advance internal/organizational hiring and professional development practices, ideally to reduce bias in decision-making.
